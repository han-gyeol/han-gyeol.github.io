I have started working on the next project, Jitsi Meet Spot. Jitsi Meet Spot is a video conference application powered by Jitsi Meet, which is suited for a physical conferecne room environment rather than a personal desktop environment.

[https://github.com/jitsi/jitsi-meet-spot/pull/1](https://github.com/jitsi/jitsi-meet-spot/pull/1)

My job was to set up a HTTP server that receives command from clients, and uses [JitsiMeetEXternalAPI](https://github.com/jitsi/jitsi-meet/blob/master/doc/api.md) to initiate the meeting, or control the conference setting such as muting the auido/video.

The HTTP command consists of two components: command type and arguments. Currently, it is missing the client side application, so the server can be tested by sending curl request.

`curl --data "command=<command.type>&args=<arguments>" <targetURL>`

The supported commands are:
1. join conference
2. hangup
3. toggle audio
4. toggle video
5. toggle film strip
6. toggle chat
7. toggle contact list
