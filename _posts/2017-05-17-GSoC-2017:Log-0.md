This summer is for code. My proposal has been accepted to the [Google Summer of Code(GSoC) 2017](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/), so I would be working under [Jitsi](https://jitsi.org/) for next few months. I never thought I would be accepted as this was my first attempt to GSoC, but hell yeah.

### Project: Implementing ‘Micro Mode’ for Jitsi-Meet-Electron

URL: [https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#4757550437236736](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#4757550437236736)

This is a simple feature for Jitsi-Meet’s desktop app, which pops up a small video and set of GUIs when the user minimizes the main window. It is a similar one to the one in Skype, hope I can make it cooler than that.

So excited to start working on the project, and many thanks in advance to the mentors [Hristo Terezov](https://github.com/hristoterezov) and [Saúl Ibarra Corretgé](https://github.com/saghul) who will be guiding(tolerating) me for the period of time. Hope I won’t fall behind.
